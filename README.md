# Beagleboard Black Midi Keyboard

## Overview

 This project is an implementation of a MIDI keyboard using a Beagleboard Black. 
 The Beagleboard Black was chosen for its abundance of GPIO pins as well as multiple hardware PWM pins. 
 This uses an array of buttons to allow for 1 full octave of notes, and uses 2 rotary encoders to select where on the full 128 note of midi that octave is.
